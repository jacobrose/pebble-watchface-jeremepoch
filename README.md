===========================

I was curious about the Pebble watch, and prices came down, so I picked one up and started playing with the C development environment. They actually had a really cool web-based development environment that could send your project directly to your wrist (via your phone), receive debugging information back, and commit your work to Github, all without installing anything but their iPhone app. Unfortunately, the watch's capabilities were extremely limited without phone integration; you could not make API calls out to the web directly; it leaned heavily on the phone for its smarts. But it had some useful functions for doing bitmasks and animation.

A coworker at Etsy who hailed from Canada seemed like the perfect face for a South Park themed watchface app, hence this post on his blog with a video of the app in action...
